# Faraday, a Clojure DynamoDB client

[DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) is *terrific* and makes a great companion for Clojure web apps that need a **simple, highly-reliable way to scale with predictable performance and without the usual headaches**. Seriously, it rocks.

Concerned about the costs? They've been [getting](http://goo.gl/qJP5d) [better](http://goo.gl/hCVxY) recently and are actually pretty decent as of May 2013.

Faraday is a fork of [Rotary](https://github.com/weavejester/rotary) by James Reaves. Why fork? Freedom to experiment rapidly+aggresively without being particularly concerned about backwards compatibility.

## What's In The Box?
 * Small, simple, **up-to-date API** (pull requests welcome!).
 * **Good performance**.
 * Flexible, high-performance **binary-safe serialization** using [Nippy](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy).

It's still (very) early days. There's a lot of rough edges, but most of them should be relatively superficial and will be ironed out as the lib sees Real-World-Useâ„¢. Again, since I'm still only evaluating DynamoDB myself: **pull requests, bug reports, and/or suggestions are very, very welcome**!

## Getting Started

DynamoDB's done a fantastic job of hiding (in a good way) a lot of the complexity (in the Rich Hickey sense) that comes with managing large amounts of data. Despite the power at your disposal, the actual API you'll be using is pretty darn simple (especially via Clojure, as usual).

### Leiningen

Depend on Faraday in your `project.clj`:

```clojure
[com.taoensso/faraday "0.1.0"]
```

and `require` the library:

```clojure
(ns my-app (:require [taoensso.faraday :as far]))
```

### Preparing A Database

First thing is to make sure you've got an **[AWS DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) account** (there's a **free tier** with 100MB of storage and limited read+write throughput).

Next you'll need credentials for an IAM user with read+write access to your DynamoDB tables (see the **IAM section of your AWS Management Console**). Ready?

### Connecting

```clojure
(def my-creds {:access-key "<AWS_DYNAMODB_ACCESS_KEY>"
               :secret-key "<AWS_DYNAMODB_SECRET_KEY>"})

(far/list-tables my-creds)
=> [] ; No tables yet...
```

Well that was easy. How about we create a table?

```clojure
;; (far/create-table ...) ; TODO

(far/list-tables my-creds)
=> [:my-users-table]
```

TODO Moar

### API

See the appropriate **docstrings for options**:

**Tables**: `list-tables`, `describe-table`, `create-table`, `ensure-table`, `update-table`, `delete-table`.

**Items**: `get-item`, `put-item`, `update-item`, `delete-item`.

**Batch items**: `batch-get-item`, `batch-write-item`.

**Querying**: `scan`, `query`.

## TODO Performance

Faraday adds negligable overhead to the official [Java AWS SDK](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/):

[Detailed benchmark information](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/TODO) is available on Google Docs.

## Faraday Supports the ClojureWerkz and CDS Project Goals

ClojureWerkz is a growing collection of open-source, batteries-included [Clojure libraries](http://clojurewerkz.org/) that emphasise modern targets, great documentation, and thorough testing.

CDS (Clojure Documentation Site) is a contributor-friendly community project aimed at producing top-notch [Clojure tutorials](http://clojure-doc.org/) and documentation.
